This file describes the definition and purpose of different factors.

1. slope_of_peak_exercise_st_segment (type: int): the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, 
an electrocardiography read out indicating quality of blood flow to the heart 

Electrocardiography : The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly 
used medical studies in the assessment of cardiovascular disease. It is the most important test 
for interpretation of the cardiac rhythm, detection of myocardial ischemia and infarction, 
conduction system abnormalities, preexcitation, long QT syndromes, 
atrial abnormalities, ventricular hypertrophy, pericarditis, and other conditions.

The heart is a two stage electrical pump and the heart's electrical activity can be measured by 
electrodes placed on the skin. The electrocardiogram can measure the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat, 
as well as provide indirect evidence of blood flow to the heart muscle.

This variable has 3 levels i.e. 1, 2, and 3

2. thal (type: categorical): results of thallium stress test measuring blood flow to the heart, 
with possible values normal, fixed_defect, reversible_defect

Thallium Stress Test : A thallium stress test is a nuclear imaging test that shows how well blood flows 
into your heart while you're exercising or at rest.

During the procedure, a liquid with a small amount of radioactivity called a radioisotope is administered into one of 
your veins. The radioisotope will flow through your bloodstream and end up in your heart. Once the radiation is in your 
heart, a special camera called a gamma camera can detect the radiation and reveal any issues your heart muscle is having.

We have 3 levels of Thallium Strees Test.

a. Fixed Defect
b. Normal : A normal test result indicates there is sufficient and unrestricted blood flow to your heart, 
both during periods of rest and exercise. Generally, there’s little concern for coronary artery disease and, 
in most cases, you won’t require any further testing.
c. Reversible Defect

3. resting_blood_pressure (type: int): resting blood pressure

Optimal typically defined as 120 mmHg systolic (pressure as heart beats) over 80 mm HG diastolic (pressure as heart relaxes).
Target heart rate while resting is between 60 and 100 beats/min.

4. chest_pain_type (type: int): chest pain type (4 values)
5. num_major_vessels (type: int): number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
6. fasting_blood_sugar_gt_120_mg_per_dl (type: binary): fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl


7. resting_ekg_results (type: int): resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. serum_cholesterol_mg_per_dl (type: int): serum cholestoral in mg/dl
9. oldpeak_eq_st_depression (type: float): oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, a measure of abnormality in electrocardiograms
10. sex (type: binary): 0: female, 1: male
11. age (type: int): age in years
12. max_heart_rate_achieved (type: int): maximum heart rate achieved (beats per minute)
13. exercise_induced_angina (type: binary): exercise-induced chest pain (0: False, 1: True)
